            "text": "How to Contribute\n\n\nThere are many ways you can help contribute to Pinax and the various apps,\nthemes, and starter projects that it is made up of. Contributing code, writing\ndocumentation, reporting bugs, as well as reading and providing feedback on\nissues and pull requests, all are valid and necessary ways to help.\n\n\nWatch the Videos\n\n\nEach month we do a Pinax Hangout, where we talk about a Pinax app or starter project, and demo how it works. Watching the videos of our \nprevious Pinax Hangouts\n might be helpful to you and might make contributing to Pinax easier. Click on the Youtube description of each video and you will find an agenda of what was discussed during a particular Hangout.\n\n\nQuestions/Help\n\n\nWhen you have questions or need help it\u2019s best to join our \nPinax project Slack channel\n and ping us there. It is also valid to create an issue and add the \nquestion\n label to it but it will usually take us longer to answer a question that has been filed as an issue than to help you in Slack.\n\n\nIf you provide us with an example of a bug you ran into, something that isn\u2019t working, something you don\u2019t understand, we will be able to help you much faster. It is totally sufficient to take a screenshot and post it in Slack or add it to your GitHub issue.\n\n\nReporting Bugs/ Requesting Features/ Making Pull Requests\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to create an issue or make a pull request on GitHub, please read \nthis blog post\n for help. If things are still unclear or you run into any problems, please don\u2019t hesitate to ping us in Slack.\n\n\nWhen you create an issue, please make sure to assign the correct labels to it. See \nthis blog post\n for help.\n\n\nCommitting Code\n\n\nWe love thoughtful contributions from the Pinax community.\nDevelopers like you improve Pinax apps all the time by filing issues\nfor bugs and feature requests, and even better by submitting pull requests.\n\n\nOne great thing about using a distributed versioning control system like git\nis that anyone can become a contributor. You can clone a repository and work\non a new feature without fear of breaking the official release.\n\n\nWe recommend that you work on bug fixes or features in a new branch from \"master\".\nFirst get the repository and create your own branch. If you are working\non pinax-ratings you'd type something like this:\n\n\nmkdir pinax-ratings\ngit clone https://github.com/pinax/pinax-ratings.git pinax-ratings\ncd pinax-ratings\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b my-new-branch\n\n\n\n\nWhen your branch is ready for review, push it to GitHub and\nopen a pull request from your branch to master.\n\n\nHere is a sample workflow of working on issue #27 with a cloned repository:\n\n\ngit checkout master\ngit checkout -b 27-frobnozz\n\n# write code\ngit commit -a -m \"Change the frobnozz\"\n\n# write code\ngit commit -a -m \"Add tests\"\n\ngit push origin 27-frobnozz\n\n\n\n\nYou are encouraged to add your name to the AUTHORS.md file in your pull\nrequests and receive credit for helping out.\nNow go to Github to create a pull request for the fix/feature!\nOnce your pull request is created, Pinax maintainers are notified and\nreview your contributions.\n\n\nWriting Commit Messages\n\n\nWriting a good commit message makes it simple for us to identify what your\ncommit does from a high-level. There are some basic guidelines we'd like to\nask you to follow.\n\n\nA critical part is that you keep the \nfirst\n line as short and sweet\nas possible. This line is important because when git shows commits and it has\nlimited space or a different formatting option is used the first line becomes\nall someone might see. If your change isn't something non-trivial or there\nreasoning behind the change is not obvious, then please write up an extended\nmessage explaining the fix, your rationale, and anything else relevant for\nsomeone reviewing the change. Lastly, if there is a\ncorresponding Github issue use the final line to provide\na message that will link the commit message to the issue and auto-close it\nif appropriate. For instance, use \n#27\n to link to issue number 27:\n\n\n    Restore ability to travel back in time\n\n    You need to be driving 88 miles per hour to generate 1.21 gigawatts of\n    power to properly use this feature.\n\n    Fixes #27\n\n\n\n\nCoding style\n\n\nWhen writing code for Pinax apps, please keep our style in mind:\n\n\n\n\nFollow \nPEP8\n. There are some\n  cases where we do not follow PEP8, but PEP8 is an excellent starting point.\n\n\nFollow \nDjango's coding style\n\n  we're pretty much in agreement on Django style outlined there.\n\n\n\n\nWe enforce a few more strict guides not outlined by PEP8 or Django's coding style:\n\n\n\n\nPEP8 tries to keep line length at 80 characters. We follow it when we can,\n  but not when it makes a line harder to read. It is okay to go a little bit\n  over 80 characters if not breaking the line improves readability.\n\n\nUse double quotes (\"double quotes\") not single quotes ('single quotes').\n  Single quotes are allowed in cases where a double quote is needed in the string.\n  For example \ntitle = 'Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson'\n. We feel code reads cleaner\n  in these situations.\n\n\nDocstrings always use three double quotes on a line of their own, so, for\n  example, a single line docstring should take up three lines not one.\n\n\nImports are grouped specifically and ordered alphabetically. This is shown\n  in the example below.\n\n\nAlways use \nreverse\n and never \n@models.permalink\n.\n\n\nTuples should be reserved for positional data structures and not used\n  where a list is more appropriate.\n\n\nURL patterns must use the \npath()\n and/or \nurl()\n functions.\n\n\nWhen callable arguments require multiple lines, place each argument\n  on a new line, indented four spaces from start of the function/method name.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of these rules applied:\n\n\n# models.py\n\n# first set of imports are stdlib imports\n# non-from imports go first then from style import in their own group\nimport csv\n\n# second set of imports are Django\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils import timezone\nfrom django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.urls import reverse\n\n# third set of imports are external apps (if applicable)\nfrom pinax. import TagField\n\n# fourth set of imports are local apps\nfrom .fields import MarkupField\nfrom .utils import frobnozz\n\n\nclass Task(models.Model):\n    \"\"\"\n    A model for storing a task.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    description = models.TextField()\n    creator = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)\n    created = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)\n    modified = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)\n\n    objects = models.Manager()\n\n    class Meta:\n        verbose_name = _(\"task\")\n        verbose_name_plural = _(\"tasks\")\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.title\n\n    def get_absolute_url(self):\n        return reverse(\"my_app:task_detail\", args=[self.pk])\n\n    def frobnozz_with_deconstrictulator(\n            self,\n            first_argument,\n            second_argument,\n            third_argument,\n            fourth_argument):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulate frobnozzes after deconstriculation\n        \"\"\"\n        # do some magic\n\n\n\n\nThis example shows use of \npath()\n and an acceptable line longer than 80 characters.\n\n\n# urls.py\n\nfrom django.urls import include, path\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path(\"account/\", include(\"account.urls\")),\n    path(\"tasks/<int:pk>/\", TaskDetail.as_view(), name=\"task_view\")\n    path(\"tasks/<int:pk>/frobnozz/<int:pk>/wilco\", TaskFrobnozz.as_view(), name=\"task_frobnozz\")\n    # more urls\n]\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nPinax apps typically support several different versions of Python and several\ndifferent versions of Django.

Install the latest version\nof each required Python \n.\n release using \npyenv\n:\n\n\n$ pyenv install 2.7.14\n$ pyenv install 3.4.7\n$ pyenv install 3.5.4\n$ pyenv install 3.6.4\n\n\n\nEnsure these versions appear in the list of installed Python versions:\n\n\n$ pyenv versions\n  3.6.4\n  3.5.4\n  3.4.7\n  2.7.14\n\n\n\nNow activate the versions required for your testing:\n\n\n$ pyenv local 3.6.4 3.5.4 3.4.7 2.7.14\n\n\n\nand verify those versions are active (indicated by an asterisk next to the version number):\n\n\n$ pyenv versions\n* 3.6.4\n* 3.5.4\n* 3.4.7\n* 2.7.14\n\n\n\nRunning tests\n\n\nFinally, invoke \ndetox\n in the same directory as \ntox.ini\n.\n\n\n$ detox\n\n\n\nIf your installation and setup worked, you should see something like this:\n\n\ncheckqa create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/checkqa\npy27-dj111 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py27-dj111\npy34-dj111 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py34-dj111\npy34-dj20 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py34-dj20\npy35-dj111 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py35-dj111\npy35-dj20 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py35-dj20\npy36-dj111 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py36-dj111\npy36-dj20 create: /Users/pinax/code/pinax-ratings/.tox/py36-dj20\n...\n\n\n\n\nEach test combination produces it's own output, so review errors carefully to understand\nwhether the problem lies with a general coding mistake or compatibility with a specific\nversion of Python and/or Django.\n\n\nWe encourage developers to test updated code before submitting a pull request.\nEvery pull request triggers our Travis continuous integration (CI) system,\nwhich automatically tests the same Python/Django configurations using \ntox.ini\n.\nA pull request which passes all tests in all configurations is a sign of quality\nand attention to detail.\n\n\nPull Requests\n\n\nIf you would like to add functionality or add a new feature, please submit an issue first to make sure it\u2019s a direction we want to take.\n\n\nPlease keep your pull requests focused on one specific thing only.
